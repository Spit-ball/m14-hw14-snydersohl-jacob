# Page Vision
    A brief hobby/interest page with a focus on imagery. Could easily be replaced with images/content I've taken myself if sized and included appropriately. The site would have the traditional nav, but the 3 cards would also function as either an internal or external navigation with the included buttons to bring users to portfolios, examples, and other similar content -- depending on if it was hosted alongside the site as well or not.
# Extra Bootstrap Components Used

## Carosel
    I leveraged the photo carosel element from Bootstrap with some random picsum images for content.

## Card
    I leveraged the card container component from Bootstrap alongside picsum images for content.
